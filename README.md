# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Vanshika**, a B.Tech ECE student based in India.

I love learning, building small projects, and exploring whatever sparks my curiosity.

If an idea comes into my mind, chances are high I’ll try to create something out of it — whether it's with **Java**, **DSA**, or **Python for data analysis**.

My current tech stack includes **Java**, **OOP**, and **basic DSA**.  
I’m also diving into Python, data handling, and beginner-friendly development tools.

When I'm not studying or coding, I’m usually journaling, exploring aesthetic things, or learning something new just for fun.
